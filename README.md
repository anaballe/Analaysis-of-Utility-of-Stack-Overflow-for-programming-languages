# Analaysis-of-Utility-of-Stack-Overflow-for-programming-languages
This project is an analysis of usefulness of Stack Overflow using K-means Cluster Algorithm(A BSP algorithm)
## This projects implements a distributed k-means algorithm which clusters posts on the popular question-answer platform StackOverflow according to their score. Moreover, this clustering should be executed in parallel for different programming languages, and the results should be compared.
## We are interested in comparing these distributions for different programming language communities. Differences in distributions could reflect differences in the availability of documentation. For example, StackOverflow could have better documentation for a certain library than that library's API documentation. However, to avoid invalid conclusions we will focus on the well-defined problem of clustering answers according to their scores.
